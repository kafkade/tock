## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffolding: GitHub templates, CI/release workflows, copilot instructions, contribution guide, and licensing (Apache-2.0 for client code, AGPL-3.0 for sync server)
- Architecture design document (`docs/architecture.md`) and Architecture Decision Records (`docs/adr/ADR-001` through `ADR-010`)
- Cargo workspace scaffold per `docs/architecture.md` §4.1: `tock-core`, `tock-crypto`, `tock-parse`, `tock-storage`, `tock-sync`, `tock-import`, `tock-export`, `tock-cli`, `tock-server`, `tock-uniffi`, plus `xtask`. Every crate is a minimal compilable placeholder
- Workspace lint table enforcing `unsafe_code = forbid`, `missing_docs`, clippy pedantic/nursery, and `deny` on `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic`/`todo` (`tock-uniffi` opts out of `unsafe_code` for FFI generation per ADR-005)
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning Rust 1.85.0 (edition 2024) with `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- `deny.toml` cargo-deny configuration (license allow-list, advisory and bans gates, registry-only sources)
- `.cargo/config.toml` with `cargo xtask` alias
- `dist-workspace.toml` for `cargo dist` (validated in CI; release workflow migration deferred)
- `flake.nix` Nix dev shell wired to the pinned toolchain plus `cargo-deny`, `cargo-llvm-cov`, `wasm-pack`
- `docs/distribution/` documenting release channels, including a Homebrew formula template at `docs/distribution/homebrew/tock.rb`
- CI pipeline expanded with `cargo deny`, `cargo dist plan`, and code coverage (Linux-only via `cargo-llvm-cov` + Codecov; non-gating initially)
- CI pinned to Rust 1.85.0 in every job to match `rust-toolchain.toml`
