.SYNOPSIS
    Prepare and cut a tock release.
.DESCRIPTION
    Automates the release process:
    1. Reads current version from Cargo.toml workspace
    2. Bumps the specified semver component (major, minor, or patch)
    3. Validates there are unreleased changelog entries
    4. Stamps the [Unreleased] section in CHANGELOG.md with version and date
    5. Runs cargo check to update Cargo.lock
    6. Commits, tags, and (optionally) pushes
.PARAMETER Bump
    Which semver component to bump: major, minor, or patch.
.PARAMETER Push
    Push the commit and tag to origin after creating them.
.PARAMETER DryRun
    Show what would happen without making changes.
.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/release.ps1 patch
    ./scripts/release.ps1 minor -Push
    ./scripts/release.ps1 major -DryRun
.NOTES
    This script will become fully usable once the Cargo workspace is scaffolded
    (Cargo.toml at the repo root with a [workspace.package] version). Sections
    referring to crates that don't exist yet are marked as TODO.
